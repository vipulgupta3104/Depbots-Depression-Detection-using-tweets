# Depbots - Depression Detection using Tweets

## Project Description

Depbots is a machine learning model that classifies whether a person is experiencing depressive feelings based on their tweets. The project leverages both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis to detect depressive emotions in social media content.

Key features of the project:

- Deployed an ML-based sentiment analysis model optimized using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
- Engineered a custom Word2Vec embedding model trained on the Sentiment140 dataset (1.6 million tweets)
- Implemented extensive text preprocessing to improve feature representation and classification accuracy
- Combines both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches

## Technical Details

### Implementation
- Built using Python with machine learning libraries like scikit-learn
- Utilizes NLP techniques and Word2Vec for text representation
- Hyperparameter tuning performed with Optuna
- Trained on large-scale tweet data (Sentiment140 dataset)

### Features
- Text preprocessing pipeline for tweet data
- Custom word embeddings trained specifically for sentiment analysis
- Multiple model architectures evaluated
- Optimized performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning

## Usage

The model can be used to analyze tweets or other short text content for signs of depressive sentiment. This could be valuable for mental health applications, social media monitoring, or psychological research.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the model development process

## Future Work

Potential enhancements include:
- Expanding to other social media platforms
- Incorporating more recent deep learning architectures
- Developing a real-time monitoring application
- Improving model interpretability
